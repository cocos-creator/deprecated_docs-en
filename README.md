# Fireball Documentation

This is Fireball Game Editor's documentation site powered by [Hexo](http://hexo.io/).

## Requirements

You need to have Nodejs 0.12+ version installed.

If you have installed Hexo cli 2.x version before, first uninstall old Hexo version:

`npm rm -g hexo`

Then start installing dependencies.

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g hexo-cli
npm install
```

## Preview Documentation

```
hexo g
hexo s
```

### Structure

We have 3 categories at the moment: tutorial，manual, api. Each resides in `source/_post` as a sub folder.
You can create new category by adding a folder at [source/_post], and populate it with markdown files.

### Front-matter

Each markdown file should start with a YAML front-matter section to define key information of the doc:

```yaml
title: My Title
categories: manual
permalinks: manual/subfolder/my-doc-link
---
```

explained:
- title: this is document's title, will be wrapped in H1 tag in the page.
- categories: one of the existing categories: `manual`、`tutorial`、`api`, or a new category you created.
- permalinks: article's path without site root. **Please note `permalinks` ends with 's'. Don't add starting or trailing slash `/` to the path.**

### Images and Other Resources

We can use two ways to insert images:

- Create an issue in [Document-image repo](https://github.com/fireball-x/document-images/issues), drag the image you want to insert into the issue description or comment. Then copy the image link generated by github markdown engine.
- Upload the image to the following folder in this repo:
```
/_posts/category/subcategory/my-file.md
/_posts/category/subcategory/my-file
                              |--screenshot.png
                              |--document.pdf
```  

You need to create a folder with the same name of the doc's filename, and they should be in the same parent folder. If the permalinks of the doc is `category/subcategory/my-title`, the link to the image should be  `category/subcategory/my-title/screenshot.png`. 

## Troubleshooting


 ### `[Error: Cannot find module './build/Release/DTraceProviderBindings'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'`

 Unknown reason for causing this issue. Reinstall local hexo with `no-optional` param to fix it:

 ```bash
 npm install hexo --no-optional
 ```
